        * **method** - `bytes` - The HTTP method, such as `b'GET'`.
        * **url** - `Tuple[bytes, bytes, Optional[int], bytes]` - The URL as a 4-tuple of
        (scheme, host, port, path).
        * **headers** - `Optional[List[Tuple[bytes, bytes]]]` - Any HTTP headers
        to send with the request.
        * **stream** - `Optional[SyncByteStream]` - The body of the HTTP request.
        * **timeout** - `Optional[Dict[str, Optional[float]]]` - A dictionary of
        timeout values for I/O operations. Supported keys are "pool" for acquiring a
        connection from the connection pool, "read" for reading from the connection,
        "write" for writing to the connection and "connect" for opening the connection.
        Values are floating point seconds.

        * **status_code** - `int` - The HTTP status code, such as `200`.
        * **reason_phrase** - `bytes` - Any HTTP reason phrase, such as `b'OK'`.
        * **headers** - `List[Tuple[bytes, bytes]]` - Any HTTP headers included
        on the response.
        * **stream** - `SyncByteStream` - The body of the HTTP response.
